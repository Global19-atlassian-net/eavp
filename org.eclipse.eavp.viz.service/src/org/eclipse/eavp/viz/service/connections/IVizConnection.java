 * This is an interface for connections intended solely for <i>consumption</i>

 * plot-specific functionality.
 * <p>
 * Instead of directly implementing this interface, classes should inherit from
 * {@link VizConnection}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Instances of this class will usually be <i>created by and acquired from</i> a
 * {@link VizConnectionManager}.
