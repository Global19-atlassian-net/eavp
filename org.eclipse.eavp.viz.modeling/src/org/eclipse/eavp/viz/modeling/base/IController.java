/**
 * A interface which is responsible for user interactions with the underlying
 * data structures which represent a part in a model. An IController is
 * associated with an IMesh, which is the internal representation of the part
 * and any associated data, and an IView, which holds the graphical
 * representation of the object in the native data types of the rendering
 * engine.
 * 
 * The IController is meant to completely encapsulate the functionality of the
 * part. All client interactions with a part should take place through function
 * calls to the part's IController, without regard as to whether they are
 * internally delegated to the model, the view, or both. The controller should
 * not expose the model or view, or their implementation details, to the client.
